### Description

This little breakout board is specifically designed for use with Raspberry Pi 5 or our RP2350 boards that have an 'HSTX' connector. These devices use a semi-standard FPC connector to pipe high speed data for video transmission over differential pairs. But maybe you want to make a custom setup or adapt to a different product? This doohickey is your pal.

Basically, you can use a 22-pin 0.5mm pitch FPC cable to connect between the two boards to get access to the four (Pi 5) or three (HSTX) differential data channels, plus the differential clock. There's also 3.3V power output, I2C, and two GPIO. We placed a fairly big ground plane and we did our best to route the signals cleanly but any time you solder wires or use a bread/perf-board with high-speed signal there's a risk of signal degradation!

Each order comes with one breakout board, 22-pin FPC cable is not included.
